<h1>Objectives</h1>

<ul>

 <li>Understand the principle of envelope detector and its relationship with Amplitude Demodulation.</li>

 <li>Review op amp circuits.</li>

</ul>

<strong>2        What to Bring</strong>

Each group should have a thumb drive to store screen images.

<h1>3      Tasks</h1>

<h2>3.1       Modulated Sine Wave (2 pics)</h2>

<ul>

 <li>Set the load of the function generator to be 50 Ohm.</li>

 <li>Use function generator to generate a modulated sine wave with baseband frequency 1kHz and modulating frequency 100kHz.</li>

</ul>

The original signal should have 4V Vpp.

The carrier (modulating) signal should be sine wave as well.

The modulation depth should be 50% (modulation index 0.5).

<ul>

 <li>Directly connect the generator to the ocsilloscope to verify your generated waveform. Store the images with time division 200<em>µs </em>and 20<em>µs</em>.</li>

 <li>In your post-lab report, give the mathematical formula of this waveform.</li>

</ul>

<strong>3.2       Modulated Triangular Wave (2 pics)</strong>

<ul>

 <li>Repeat Part 1, with the only difference that the original signal should have triangular shape.</li>

</ul>

<h2>3.3       Envelop Detector (4 pics)</h2>

<ul>

 <li>Assemble the circuit using <em>R </em>= 75<em>K</em>Ω and <em>C </em>= 2<em>.</em>2<em>nF</em>.</li>

 <li>Use the envelope detector to ”demodulate” the two signals in Part 1 and 2. Store your images still at <em>T </em>= 200<em>µs </em>and 20<em>µs</em>. In each image, be sure to display both CH1 (as input) and CH2 (as output).</li>

</ul>

<h2>3.4      Amplifier (1 pic)</h2>

<ul>

 <li>Use the function generator to generate a 5kHz sine wave with 500 mV Vpp.</li>

 <li>Assemble the circuit using <em>R</em><sub>1 </sub>= 15<em>k</em>Ω, <em>R</em><sub>2 </sub>= 5<em>.</em>6<em>k</em>Ω, <em>R</em><sub>3 </sub>= 82<em>k</em>Ω and <em>C </em>= 220<em>µF</em>. Capture both input and output on the Ocsilloscope. Compare the measured gain of your amplifier with the calculated value.</li>

</ul>

<h1>4      Deliverables</h1>

Each team should submit one post-lab report.
